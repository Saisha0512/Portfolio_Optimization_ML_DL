# Portfolio Optimization using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Portfolio Optimization with ML/DL** repository!  
This project explores and implements various portfolio optimization strategies leveraging the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Investors often face challenges in:
- Selecting the right combination of financial assets.
- Balancing risk vs. return effectively.
- Adapting to market volatility and evolving trends.
- Traditional manual approaches and outdated models fail to adapt to modern financial markets’ complexity.

Key Question: **How can we automatically suggest optimal portfolio allocations that maximize returns while minimizing risk using ML and DL techniques?**

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional portfolio optimization techniques, such as Mean-Variance Optimization, have their limitations in dynamic financial markets. This project aims to enhance portfolio construction by integrating ML/DL algorithms for smarter asset allocation, risk prediction, and return maximization.
